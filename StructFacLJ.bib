abstract = {There has recently been extensive interest in the nature of the melting/freezing transition for a two-dimensional system of molecules interacting with Lennard-Jones 6:12 potentials, which is a prototype for physisorbed systems. We have therefore made a detailed study of the thermodynamics of the phase diagram for this system. We first made calculations using liquid-state perturbation theory for the fluid state and a self-consistent cell theory for the solid state to determine thermodynamic functions; these results led to ordinary first-order phase transitions between solid/fluid and liquid/gas phases, in agreement with the constant-pressure Monte Carlo results of Abraham. We refined the calculations by using constant-pressure and constant-density Monte Carlo results to improve the accuracy of the calculated free energies, and we determined the two-phase equilibria by making direct Monte Carlo calculations for two-phase systems. The results are internally consistent and lead to a phase diagram qualitatively similar to the three-dimensional Lennard-Jones system. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

@article{Morrison1973,
abstract = {Numerical values of reduced second and third virial coefficients and their temperature derivatives are reported for a two-dimensional gas, for use in interpreting adsorption isotherms of monolayers on isoenergetic substrates. Correct values of the third virial coefficient have not been available before. Examples of earlier treatments of adsorption data are given to demonstrate that values of the higher virial coefficients are essential for adequate discussions of adsorption isotherms. When these are used the high-temperature adsorption isotherms of argon on graphitized carbon black in the monolayer region are completely described in terms of the unperturbed bulk-gas parameters. {\textcopyright} 1973.},

@article{Dijkstra2000,
abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations are used to investigate the asymptotic decay of the total pairwise correlation function h(r) for some model fluids. We determine the poles of the Fourier transform ĥ(q) from the direct correlation function c(r). The leading poles determine the ultimate, r→∞, decay of h(r). For the truncated and shifted Lennard-Jones fluid we calculate the Fisher–Widom (disorder) line in the temperature-density (T,$\rho$) plane where the ultimate decay of rh(r) crosses over from monotonic (exponential) to exponentially damped oscillatory decay. This line lies close to that obtained in an earlier integral-equation [hypernetted chain-soft core mean spherical approximation (HMSA)] study. For states on the monotonic side of the disorder line, h(r) has a finite number of oscillations and we determine the boundaries which mark regions in the (T,$\rho$) plane where h(r) has a given number of zeros using a random-phase approximation for c(r). In the case of the hard-sphere fluid, the ultimate decay of h(r) is oscillatory for all densities and we find that simulation results for the period and (exponential) decay length of the oscillations are in good overall agreement with those of Percus–Yevick theory, although there is some indication that systematic differences develop for high-density states $\rho$∗ ≥ 0.85.},

@article{Zhao2011,
abstract = {The direct correlation function (DCF) plays an important role in liquid integral-equation theories and non-mean-field applications of the classical density functional theory (DFT). While for a simple fluid the DCF can easily be calculated from the radial distribution function via the Fourier transform and/or, for special cases, can be derived from analytical solutions of the Ornstein?Zernike equation, computation of the site?site DCFs of a molecular fluid is more challenging because of numerical issues associated with solving the matrix integral equations. This paper describes a new theoretical method for accurate evaluation of the site?site DCFs of molecular fluids by combination of molecular simulation and analytical asymptotic analysis. The computational procedure entails four steps: (1) molecular simulation is used to calculate the site?site total correlation functions (TCFs) in real space; (2) the reference-interaction-site model (RISM) is used to calculate the site?site DCFs in Fourier space at large wavenumbers; (3) asymptotic expressions are derived for the TCFs and DCFs in the limit of small wavenumbers; and (4) site?site DCFs over the entire range are obtained by interpolation of the asymptotic results. The numerical procedure has been illustrated by application to bulk SPC/E water. Accurate evaluation of the site?site DCFs for water lays a foundation for future applications of the DFT to aqueous systems with atomic details.

@article{Verlet1968,
abstract = {Equilibrium correlation functions for a dense classical fluid are obtained by integrating the equation of motion of a system of 864 particles interacting through a Lennard-Jones potential. The behavior of the correlation function at large distance, and that of its Fourier transform at large wave number, are discussed in detail and shown to be related to the existence of a strong repulsion in the potential. A simple hard-sphere model is shown to reproduce very well the Fourier transform of those correlation functions at high density, the only parameter of the model being the diameter a of the hard spheres.},
